## Introduction

This project was inspired by the need for a straightforward and user-friendly application to manage daily tasks. The To-Do List application allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks, helping them stay organized and productive.

## Features

- **Easy Task Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks effortlessly.
- **Filter Tasks**: View tasks by status: active, completed, or all tasks.
- **Organize by Date and Time**: Schedule tasks with specific dates and times.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite (can be upgraded to PostgreSQL or other databases)
- **Templating Engine**: Jinja2
- **Styling**: Custom CSS

## Architecture

The application follows a simple MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

- **Model**: Defines the structure of tasks stored in the database.
- **View**: HTML templates rendered using Jinja2.
